# Dashboard for Oil Filtering machine

A flask app developed to automate the process of controlling a hydraulic press, oil filtering machine. The physical monitoring, knobs and switches of the machine can be all controlled through a RPi 7" touch screen coupled with an Arduino. It involved serial communication through UART between Raspberry Pi and Arduino, which is further connected to a relay. It is designed for a minimal and efficient interface. The dashboard monitors real time values of parameters like voltage, current, motor, transformer states, controlling them, graphical analysis, alert messages, acknowlegements, UI guide, etc.
